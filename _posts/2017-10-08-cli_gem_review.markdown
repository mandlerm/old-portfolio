I am learning to be okay with failing - it just means I'm trying something!

This is the largest project yet.  Staring at a completely blank page is much different from writing a few classes.

This project put me two weeks behind my planned pace; two frustrating weeks.  Multiple days staring at that blank screen, multiple days watching the same video walkthrough over and over, multiple days wondering how to even being.

But begin I did:

Stubbing out the CLI gave me some initial progress before having to tackle any of the heavy hitting.

With the overall structure of the program in place, I could begin to address the larger issues, one by one.

I reminded myself that all I have to code is the next thing.  That next thing will bring both immediate satisfaction, and get me a step closer to the next step.

So with the CLI stubbed out, I began with the first level scraper.  At first, I hard coded in the URL to test the code.  Then utilizing IRB and Inspect via Chrome, I identified the needed css elements to target the desired information.  As time went on with this project, I became more adept at quickly and effectively scraping the data.

With the first level scraping in place, I began replaced the stub code working code.

Once the first level coding was complete, I repeated the process with the level two scraping.

When it came to the third level of scraping, accessing the details of each recipe, there were a few additional challenges, requiring additional formatting.  But with a little trial and error, those issue were resolved.


Overall, I learned to simply start.  Do what I know how to do, and not worry about the rest.  Taking each step one by one, a project that at first seemed unsurmountable became quite doable.
