A week into my Rails Portfolio Project and almost back to (alomost) square one...again, the lesson I have learned is 


# Take the time to plan!!

I had an idea that I wanted to build.  Solve a problem you have, 'they say', and so I saw this as a great opportunity to kill two birds with one stone.  I'd use my Rails project time to build a simple budgeting tracker that had the exact specs I wanted and none of the specs I didn't want.

Three days in I conceeded that, while I'm sure there was *some* way to make it work, I really needed a concept that more directly and clearly fit the project requirements.

Looking at a few past projects of other students for inspiration, I landed on a book tracking app to keep track of books on my 'to read' list and books I've read categorized by category (instead of genre), ie. Business, Programming, Educational, etc.

This seemed to more cleanly meet the requirements, but there was still an aspect I was forcing.  The required join table I had was forced rather than natural.  It didn't serve the domain model, it was just there because I needed a join table.

And so, a week into working on this project and I am once again rethinking my domain model. 

Thankfully, I already have Devise and OmniAuth wired up, so I'm not quite back at the very beginning, but close enough for me to learn....PLAN BEFORE YOU JUMP.
