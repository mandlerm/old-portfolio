### I'm too old (36).

### I'm not techie.

### I was never that good at math.



These are just some of the excuses, doubts, and fears that have kept me from jumping into code sooner. But a few months ago I came across a label for these insecurities and the lack of confidence  that so freely invades my thoughts: 

> IMPOSTER SYNDROME

Oh, how that title was music to my ears.  
   It meant I wasn’t crazy.
   It meant I wasn't alone.
   But most importantly, it meant that the fears I had were only fears, and not a sign of reality.

After being quick out of the (college) gates, advancing rapidly up the ranks of my company, I chose to leave at the age of 25 to take on the role of a mom.  For the last decade that has been my main job - and I wouldn't trade it for the world.  I was content to be Mom (homeschool mom more precisely).

Oh, I dabbled in the working world here and there -- coached some soccer at my old Middle and High Schools, ran a consulting firm for a bit, and wrote a book among other endeavors.  But professionally, I had no aspirations other than to teach and mother my children well.

But life changes.  And often quickly.

While I was content to leave the corporate world behind me and simply dabble here and there, my bank account wasn’t.  Finding myself a single mom of four children, my work efforts would need to provide a significant financial influx.  

Refusing to give up my identity of homeschooling mom, and unwilling to follow cultural norms for my kids due to circumstances rather then deliberate choices, I resigned myself to low expectations and barely kept my head above the financial drowning point for a number years.

But now, with kids at more independent ages as well as an understanding that my fear of being an imposter is misplaced, it was time to pursue not just a job, but a career.  And not just a career. but a path of creativity.

I dabbled with code in High School and College, taking a few classes in C++ and C#.  I had touched some HTML back in the infancy of web design.  I knew I enjoyed code, but never before thought I could succeed at a professional level because "I'm not good at math" and "not very techie."

But after starting with Codecademy, and then going through the Flatiron Bootcamp, I was hooked.  I once again felt the wonderfully addicting power of writing code and watching a computer respond. Hours spent at the keyboard seemed like mere moments.  I felt empowered by the ability to manipulate a website in the precise way I wanted, not limited by the restrictions of a theme.  Ideas I've had for apps and services became projects to eventually accomplish instead of *nice ideas* that I really had no ability to create and construct.

So I decided that this stay-at-home mom would become a software developing mom.  I realized this wasn’t a field beyond my abilities, but simply an avenue in which I needed training.  In the same way I encourage my children to embrace challenges, I’ve chosen to pursue this intellectual challenge with full-force, excited at the prospect of combining my MBA with programming skills that will position me to be a valuable contributor to any company, as well as enable me to put into motion my own side projects.

> I expect to be challenged.  I anticipate struggle and frustration and even despair.  But I am looking over that mountain peak to the valley beyond.
